PAPER_RIGOR_RULES = """\

SCIENTIFIC RIGOR — these make a paper publishable; a violation reads as a reject:
- KEY PRINCIPLES: carry 1-2 key ideas and keep the rest simple; tell a short, rigorous,
  evidence-based story with ONE clear takeaway; make the baselines genuinely
  competitive; ablate ONE component at a time and measure its effect; acknowledge
  limitations honestly.
- FOCUS ON THE IDEA AND THE FINDINGS, NOT THE PROCEDURE: the paper is about the core
  IDEA and what you FOUND — not a log of what you did. Write each CONTRIBUTION as an
  insight / mechanism and a discovered result, leading with the finding ("X improves Y
  because Z"), NEVER as an activity ("we implement…", "we run…", "we evaluate…").
  Procedure exists only to support the finding — keep it minimal.
- EVIDENCE-BOUNDING: every claim in the title, abstract, and conclusion MUST be backed
  by a specific measured number in the results. If only some conditions were tested, the
  title must NOT make a global claim — prefer "Toward…" / "An Empirical Study of…" over
  "X Dominates Y", and claim only what the tested numbers show. Distinguish "we propose
  and validate" (full results) from "we present preliminary evidence" (partial).
- REPRODUCIBLE, IN THE RIGHT SECTION: the paper as a whole must carry every detail
  needed to re-implement — but place each where it belongs. The METHOD gives the
  algorithm / formulation and the model architecture; the EXPERIMENTS setup (or an
  Appendix) gives the experiment settings and hyperparameters and each baseline's exact
  configuration (plus any tuning). Do NOT enumerate experiment settings or parameters
  inside the Method section.
- NAME METHODS DESCRIPTIVELY: never use generic labels ("baseline_1", "variant_2",
  "ours_v3") in the paper — name each method/condition for what it actually does, so the
  results stay interpretable.
- FAILURE-AWARE REPORTING: if a method fails on some runs (does not always complete),
  report the per-method success rate and the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and give BOTH
  conditional (successful runs only) and unconditional (failures as worst-case) numbers
  so the comparison isn't biased by survivorship; discuss any instability or divergence
  in Limitations.
- PER-REGIME RESULTS + STATISTICS: fully specify the evaluation setup (data/inputs,
  conditions, any randomization). When a result spans regimes (conditions / sizes /
  difficulty / noise levels), report PER REGIME in separate tables or sub-sections —
  aggregate-only numbers can't support robustness or generality claims. WHERE YOU HAVE
  MULTIPLE RUNS/SEEDS, report an uncertainty measure (95% CI or mean ± std) in every
  results table and back each "A outperforms B" claim with a significance signal (paired
  CI of the difference, or a p-value); if the gap is not reliable, write
  "comparable"/"competitive" rather than claiming superiority. NEVER fabricate or
  approximate a number or a statistic.
- CITE PRIOR WORK INLINE — NO UNCITED CLAIMS: every sentence that describes, compares
  to, or builds on previous work MUST carry an inline citation to the SPECIFIC paper at
  that exact point. An Introduction or Related Work that discusses prior work WITHOUT
  citations is a defect — fix it. The INTRODUCTION must cite DENSELY: nearly every
  sentence, from the broad application/domain framing through the prior work, carries a
  citation; the only uncited sentences are the ones stating YOUR approach/contributions.
- DON'T DUMP CITATIONS: attach the ONE right reference to the ONE claim where it belongs;
  do NOT pile long bracketed lists ([3,5,7,9,11]…), and group several references only
  when you genuinely mean "a body of work shows…". Quality of placement over count.
- CITE ORIGINAL PAPERS: whenever you use or discuss an established technique, tool,
  dataset, or metric, ALWAYS cite the ORIGINAL paper that introduced it — NEVER a survey
  or a later follow-up in its place. Prefer the foundational reference over a convenient
  recent one.
- BASELINE MODERNITY: state whether the baselines represent CURRENT practice. If a
  baseline is an older method, say explicitly WHY you chose it and acknowledge that
  stronger modern alternatives exist — do not quietly compare against only weak or
  outdated baselines.
- CITATION RELEVANCE: cite only directly relevant work — do NOT pad with tangentially
  related papers.
- LIMITATIONS HYGIENE: state each limitation ONCE, in a concise Limitations section (3-5
  key items); do NOT scatter caveats through every section. Keep the whole paper centered
  on the IDEA and the FINDINGS — not on procedure or on what you could not do.

REAL data and records measured results.

Output ONLY a single fenced ```python block — the complete script, nothing else.

FOLLOW THE PLAN — this is the most important rule:
- Use the EXACT datasets the plan names. Load the REAL data with standard loaders
  and DOWNLOAD it if needed — e.g. `datasets` (HuggingFace), `torchvision.datasets`,
  `sklearn.datasets.fetch_*`, `openml`, GluonTS, or a documented public URL. Do
  NOT fabricate, "synthesize", or rename-with-_synthetic a stand-in for a named
  dataset (e.g. NEVER make an `electricity_synthetic` in place of the real
  Electricity benchmark).
- Use the baselines / ablations and the metrics the plan specifies, and evaluate
  the plan's acceptance criteria against the measured numbers.

Keep it efficient WITHOUT abandoning the plan:
- Fit the time/compute budget by SUBSAMPLING the real dataset (a subset of
  series / a few thousand examples), using a small model and few epochs/seeds.
  Use the GPU if available (torch.cuda). Subsampling the REAL data is fine;
  replacing it with synthetic data is NOT.
- ONLY if a named dataset genuinely cannot be obtained (no network, or truly
  unavailable) may you fall back to the closest REAL alternative, or — as an
  absolute last resort — synthetic data. If you do, you MUST set a top-level
  "data_note" in results.json saying exactly what you used and why, and mention it
  in "observations". Never silently substitute.
- Prefer numpy / scikit-learn / torch; if an import is missing, try a lighter
  real-data approach rather than crashing.

- Print progress to stdout (dataset loading, training, evaluation).
- Write a file named `results.json` in the current directory with EXACTLY this
  schema:

       "metrics": {"<method or baseline>": {"<metric>": number, ...}, ...},

    "data_note": str,   // OPTIONAL: include ONLY if you could not use a planned dataset
    "figures": [{"file": "fig1.png", "caption": str}]   // optional; omit if none
  }
- If you produce figures, use matplotlib with the "Agg" backend and save them as
  PNG files in the current directory, then list them under "figures".

  outcomes. Never hard-code fake results, and never pass off synthetic data as a

- ```python …```        shorthand for ```write run.py``` (the entry point).

ENGINEER LIKE A PRO:
- EXPLORE FIRST: `ls -R` and `cat` the plan / any provided files before coding.
- DECOMPOSE into modules (e.g. data.py, model.py, train.py, eval.py) with a small
  `run.py` entry point that wires them together and writes `results.json`.
- ITERATE on the SAME files: when a run fails, READ the traceback and the relevant
  file, then `patch` the specific cause — don't restart from scratch or just
  suppress the error.

FOLLOW THE PLAN — use the EXACT datasets, baselines/ablations, and metrics it
names. Load the REAL named datasets (download them with `datasets`/torchvision/
sklearn/openml/a public URL). SUBSAMPLE for speed and use the GPU if available,
but NEVER substitute synthetic data for a named benchmark. If a dataset is truly
unobtainable, use the closest real alternative and record a top-level "data_note".

missing; record REAL measured numbers (never fabricate); keep each step within a
reasonable runtime.

CLI_AGENT_TASK = """\
You are running headlessly as an autonomous coding agent in the CURRENT working
directory to execute a research experiment end-to-end. You have a Linux shell,
Python, and full read/write access to this directory. Work autonomously to
completion — do NOT ask questions or wait for confirmation.

# CRITICAL — run in the FOREGROUND and finish on the DELIVERABLE
- Run training/evaluation IN THE FOREGROUND and BLOCK until it finishes. Do NOT
  background or detach the work: no trailing `&`, no `nohup`, `disown`, `setsid`,
  `tmux`/`screen`, no "launch it and check back later", no separate task you poll.
  There is NO timeout — a long run is fine; the harness streams your output live, so
  just let it run to completion in the foreground.
- Your turn MUST NOT end while work is still running. If you end your turn (report
  done) while a job is still going in the background, that job is KILLED and the
  experiment is recorded as a FAILURE with no results.
- Do NOT report done until `results.json` exists in THIS directory with REAL measured
  numbers. As your FINAL step, verify it: `cat results.json` (or load+print it) to
  confirm it is present and valid JSON, THEN finish.

# Research idea
{idea}

# Experiment plan (FOLLOW IT EXACTLY)
{plan}

# Your task
1. Set up the environment (install missing packages with `pip install -q ...`).
2. Use the EXACT datasets, baselines/ablations, and metrics the plan names. Load
   the REAL named datasets (download via `datasets`/torchvision/sklearn/openml/a
   public URL). SUBSAMPLE for speed and use the GPU if available — but NEVER
   substitute synthetic data for a named benchmark. If a dataset is truly
   unobtainable, use the closest REAL alternative and say why in "data_note".
3. Write your script(s), run them, inspect the output, and fix errors until the
   experiment completes with REAL measured numbers (honest — including negative
   or inconclusive outcomes; never fabricate).
4. Produce the PUBLICATION-QUALITY figures from the plan's "## Figures" section as
   PNG files in this directory (matplotlib/seaborn) — paper-ready: labeled axes with
   units, a legend, readable fonts, a colorblind-safe palette, tight layout, high DPI
   (>=200). At least one must show the MAIN result vs the baselines. List them under
   "figures" in results.json. (If the plan names none, still save the key result plot.)

# Required output
Write a file named `results.json` in THIS directory with EXACTLY this schema:
{
  "experiments": [
    {"name": str, "setup": str,
     "metrics": {"<method or baseline>": {"<metric>": number, ...}, ...},
     "hypothesis": str,
     "verdict": "SUPPORTED" | "REFUTED" | "INCONCLUSIVE",
     "status": "POSITIVE" | "MIXED" | "NEGATIVE",
     "observations": str}
  ],
  "summary": str,
  "data_note": str,   // OPTIONAL: only if a planned dataset could not be used
  "figures": [{"file": "fig1.png", "caption": str}]   // optional; omit if none
}
`results.json` is the deliverable — the run is judged complete only once it exists.
Write it in the FOREGROUND and CONFIRM it on disk before you finish; never end your
turn expecting a still-running background job to produce it.
"""

EXPERIMENT_CODE_FIX = """\
The script failed when executed. Here is the captured error output:

---
{error}
---

Return the COMPLETE corrected `run.py` again as a single ```python block. Fix the
root cause; do not just suppress the error. Still FOLLOW THE PLAN — keep using the
planned real datasets (subsample if a download is slow; if a dataset download
failed, retry it or use another real source). Do NOT switch to synthetic data to
dodge the error unless the dataset is truly unobtainable (then set "data_note").
Keep it efficient and still write `results.json` with the required schema.
