"""Slash-command skill registry for PaperClaw.

Skills are the commands surfaced by the `/` menu in the chat interface.
Each skill has a command string (e.g. `/create_domain`) and a description
shown to the user.

Skill *execution* (the actual handler logic) lives in service.py; this
package only holds the registry and command-name constants so both the
HTTP route and the service can import from a single source of truth.
